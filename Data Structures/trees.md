Data structure that consists of a parent/child relationship
Trees work top down
Nodes can only relate to their children
Child nodes do not link back upwards, and can not link to their sibling nodes


Root - top node in a tree
Child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
Parent - the converse node of a child
Siblings - group of nodes with the same parent
Leaf - node with no children
Edge - connection between one node and another

Use cases
    HTML DOM is a tree
    Network Routing
    Abstract Syntax Trees
    Artificial Intelligence
    OS Folders

Binary Trees
    Used for data that can be sorted/compared
    Each node can have at most two children
    Every node to the left of the parent is always less than the parent
    Every node to the right is greater than the parent

    Easy to find items and place items in their correct position
    Each comparison eliminates ~half of the options
